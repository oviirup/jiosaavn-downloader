## How It Works

The extension fetches data from JioSaavn's API endpoints and organizes it in a user-friendly manner. This process occurs entirely within the browser and does not rely on external servers.

Once the data is fetched, it retrieves the URL for the song, album, or playlist in your preferred quality settings. The extension then sends an HTTP request to the server to fetch the M4A file. This step requires CORS to be enabled in your browser. In previous versions, this required an additional extension, but it is now integrated.

For playlists or albums, the extension fetches the individual songs and downloads them individually, placing them inside a ZIP file for easy download.
